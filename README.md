<h1>Welcome to the FFN repository!</h1>

**FFN** stands for **Feedforward Network**, which is a fundamental model in the field of neural networks. This repository contains a basic implementation of a Feedforward Network coded in C (C11 standard).

<h2>Short description</h2>
The Feedforward Network is a type of artificial neural network where the information flows only in one direction, from input to output. This architecture is widely used in various fields of research, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.

The library includes features such as activation functions and weight initialization. The code is implemented using C11 standard, which makes it compatible with a wide range of systems.

If you are interested in learning about neural networks and want to explore the Feedforward Network model, **this repository isn't a great starting point lmao**.

<em>Thank you for checking out the FFN repository! I hope you find it useful in your research or projects.</em>
